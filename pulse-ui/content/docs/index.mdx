If you don't want to put much effort and time into designing your websites, It's hard to build something unique looking these days.
Most of the UI libraries out here are very generic and hard to distinguish from each other.

<br />
So when I started getting into `Retro/Neobrutalist design system`, I wanted to
build my personal website with this design. But I couldn't find a UI library
that fit what I was looking for, So I start building my own!

<br />

### Welcome to RetroUI, The UI library that let's you build unique and playful websites.

Follow the [Installation Guide](/docs/install) to get started.
