The `cn` utility function combines `clsx` and `tw-merge`.
This enables you to construct className strings conditionally without having to worry about Tailwind CSS style conflicts.

<br />
<br />

## Installation

#### 1. Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install clsx tailwind-merge
```

<br />

#### 2. Copy the code ðŸ‘‡ into your `lib/utils.ts` file:

```ts
import clsx from "clsx";
import { ClassNameValue, twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

export function cn(...classes: ClassNameValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(classes));
}
```
